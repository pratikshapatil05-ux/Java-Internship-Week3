# Java-Internship-Week3
This week focuses on understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
You will learn how to create classes, objects, constructors, encapsulated data, and simple class relationships.

1. Theory Concepts Covered
* Introduction to OOP

What is Object-Oriented Programming

Real-world modeling using objects

OOP pillars (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

* Classes and Objects

Class = blueprint

Object = real entity created from class

How to define attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods)

* Constructors & Method Overloading

Default constructor

Parameterized constructor

Constructor initialization

Method overloading (same method name, different parameters)

* Access Modifiers
Modifier	Access
public	Accessible everywhere
private	Within same class only
protected	Same package + subclasses
default	Same package
* Encapsulation & Data Hiding

Variables declared as private

Accessed using getters and setters

Protects data from unauthorized access

* Basic Class Relationships
Has-a relationship
Uses-a relationship
Simple object interactions

 2. Hands-On Practice Programs
This week includes the following practice programs:

* Student Program
Create Student class
Attributes: name, age, marks
Methods: display(), setData()

* BankAccount Program
deposit(), withdraw(), checkBalance()
private balance with getters/setters

* Book Program

Book details (title, author, price)
Display method
Constructor initialization

* Car Program

Properties: brand, model, year

Behaviors: start(), stop()

* Multiple Objects Program

Create multiple Person objects

Store and display details

* Encapsulation Program

Employee class with private data

Getter/Setter implementation

All these programs are included in the Hands-On-Programs folder.

3. Week 3 Project – Library Management System

The project demonstrates OOP concepts by creating:

📌 Book Class

title, author, available flag

constructor + getters/setters

📌 Member Class

name, memberId

methods to issue and return books

📌 LibrarySystem Class

Create Book and Member objects

Perform issue/return operations

Display book availability

This project focuses on:

Encapsulation

Class interactions

Constructor usage

Object behavior

All project files are located inside the Project/ folder.

 5. Learning Outcomes

By completing Week 3, you will be able to:

* Create classes and objects
* Use constructors (default + parameterized)
* Apply method overloading
* Use access modifiers (public/private/protected)
* Implement encapsulation with getters and setters
* Build interconnected classes for real-world problems
* Understand how OOP improves code structure
